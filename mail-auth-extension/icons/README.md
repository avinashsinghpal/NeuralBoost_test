# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Setup

You can use any image editor or online tool to create simple placeholder icons, or:

1. Create a simple colored square (e.g., blue #4285f4)
2. Add text "MA" for "MailAuth"
3. Export as PNG at the required sizes

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome may show a warning. The icons are optional for basic functionality.
